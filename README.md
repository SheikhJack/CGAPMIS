Project Name: PEEPA
Overview
This project is a web application built using Next.js that incorporates an authentication flow to manage user access to various sections of the application. The main feature of this app is its entry point, where users are initially redirected to an authentication page (/auth/entry). The application ensures that users go through the authentication process to access the rest of the app's content.

Features
Authentication Flow: The application starts by redirecting users to the authentication page (/auth/entry) where they can log in.
Entry Page (/auth/entry): This is the entry point where users can sign in.
Redirects: After successful login, users are redirected to their respective dashboards or home page.
Protected Routes: Certain routes in the app are protected, requiring authentication to access them.
How It Works
Initial Access (/auth/entry)
When a user first accesses the application, they are directed to /auth/entry.
This is the authentication page where users enter their credentials.
Authentication Process
Users will be asked to provide their credentials (e.g., email and password) in the form on the /auth/entry page.
Upon submitting the form, the app verifies the credentials (via API or other methods) and checks whether they are correct.
Successful Authentication
If the credentials are valid, the user is redirected to the appropriate page based on their role or the default home page.
The redirection is done using the useRouter hook in Next.js or any other navigation method (like window.location.href or window.history.pushState).
Protected Routes
Certain routes in the app are protected and will redirect unauthorized users back to the /auth/entry page if they attempt to access them without authentication.
The authentication status (e.g., a token or session) is checked before rendering any page that requires it.
Persistent Authentication
User session data can be stored in localStorage, cookies, or any other persistent storage to keep the user logged in across sessions.
The app checks for the presence of authentication tokens on page load to determine whether the user is authenticated.
How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Version 16 or higher
npm or yarn: For managing dependencies
Steps to Run the Application
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CGAPMIS
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Or, if you prefer yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Or, if you're using yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn dev
Open the app in your browser:

Visit http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

The first page you will see is /auth/entry, where users can log in.
Running Tests
If you have automated tests set up for your project, you can run them using:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run test
Or, if you're using yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn test
Deployment
For deploying the app to a live environment, follow the deployment steps according to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

Technologies Used
Next.js: A React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated applications.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS: For styling the app (if applicable).
JWT (Optional): For managing authentication tokens.
Local Storage: For persisting authentication tokens and session data.
Troubleshooting
Error: NextRouter was not mounted
If you encounter this error, it means that useRouter was called outside of the component tree or before the app was fully mounted. To resolve this, ensure that useRouter is only used inside a functional component, and that the component is rendered in the page or layout.
